    "* document how you use '_generalization_' in your setup (us of simple hold-out/train-test split or k-fold, or etc..),\n",
    "* produce some sort of '_learning-curve_' that illustrates the drop in cost- or increase in score-function with respect to, say training iteration (for inspiration see fig 4.20, 10-12 or 10.17 in [HOML]),\n",
    "* document the final CNN setup (layers etc., perhaps as a graph/drawing), \n",
