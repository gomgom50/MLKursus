    "### About Anaconda Package Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda comes with two different package managers: `conda` and `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `conda` is the preferred package manager, that will check new package installation for compatibility with existing packages. While this pre-compatibility check is nice in theory, it often turns out, that it becomes impossible to install a given package due to incompatibilities with one or more other packages. Even more annoying, the simple installation of a package may take hours to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pip` is a simpler package manager, that comes with most Python distributions. It does none of the compatibility checks when installing; it just installs whatever you ask it to (and incompatibility may then creep in in the run-time environment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally you would try to install whatever you need via `conda` and when it breaks down due to too many broken dependencies (trying with 'flexible solve' etc. for hours), you just continue with `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you just want a quick(-and-dirty?) install of `keras` and `tensorflow` goto the \"Install via PIP\" cell, otherwise try the \"Install via CONDA\".\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: the new 2022.XX Anaconda version seemingly lets you install `keras` and `tensorflow` without hick-ups, version 2023.YY has not been tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: when you get of tired waiting for `conda`, then you should try `mamba` instead. You still need to `conda` install `mamba` but from then on, it can replace the inefficient Python-based `conda` with a more efficient C++ backend. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: when you then get tired of waiting for `mamba`, then you should try `micromamba`, a 100% C++ based implementation, somewhat more efficient than `mamba`. "
